In the card deck you'll find 66 carefully curated questions that fit into many environments in which you would want to play. The courageous questions and simple guidelines of WhoCards create an atmosphere where people can relax and open up. In the Box you'll find a Tips & Tricks booklet that explains you how to play.",

      "If you choose to pre-order WhoCards, we invite you to join us spreading our mission by giving away at least a pack to someone who will treasure it, especially during the upcoming holiday season! Why? Because our small team can't spread the magic of WhoCards alone. We need all of us to create waves of meaningful and authentic connections around the globe! If this resonates with you, we warmly invite you to pre-order. If you'd like to buy only one pack of WhoCards, we ask for your patience while we finish with this campaign and we start making them available on an individual basis.",
