    subtitle='Our story'
    title='The power of human connections'
    description={`In 2016, a dynamic, self-organized laboratory called Amanitas was born in order to explore radical collaboration and emergence for our future humanity. Amanitas was inspired by the superpowers and patterns of the natural world. Throughout a series of retreats, a community house and co-created events, we learnt, played and experimented around a core belief: That positive change does not originate from any single individual, rather it ebbs and flows as a force which guides a living system.`}

      <p class='leading-snug text-gray-dark pb-2 lg:text-lg lg:max-w-3xl lg:tracking-tight'>
        WhoCards were born as part of this experiment, as a helper to go beyond starting
        conversations with questions related to our job titles, identities and social status.
        Instead of leaning on socially acceptable questions like, “What do you do?” or “Where are
        you from?,” we focused on “Who are you?” and a myriad of subsequent questions like “What
        does happiness mean to you?”, “How do you want to grow old?” or “What was the last thing you
        cried about?”
      </p>
      <p class='leading-snug text-gray-dark pb-2 lg:text-lg lg:max-w-3xl lg:tracking-tight'>
        Since then, countless people have found delight in using our carefully curated questions
        across the planet amongst a manifold of different contexts. From garden parties with family
        or friends to strategic and innovation workshops, from orthodox jewish matchmaking dates to
        political negotiations; WhoCards have helped us to move beyond social anxiety, disconnection
        and loneliness.
      </p>
      <p class='leading-snug text-gray-dark pb-2 lg:text-lg lg:max-w-3xl lg:tracking-tight'>
        As a result we, humans, were able to playfully find commonalities with others while holding
        completely different beliefs, norms and ideas about what it means to be alive today.
