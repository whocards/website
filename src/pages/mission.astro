        In 2016, a dynamic, self-organised laboratory called <a

          href='https://www.amanitas.cc/'
          target='_blank'>Amanitas</a
        > was born in order to explore radical collaboration and emergence for our future humanity. Amanitas
        was inspired by the superpowers and patterns of the natural world. Throughout a series of retreats,
        a community house and co-created events, we learnt, played and experimented around a core belief:
        That positive change does not originate from any single individual, rather it ebbs and flows
        as a force which guides a living system.

      <p>
        WhoCards were born as part of this experiment, as a helper to go beyond starting
        conversations with questions related to our job titles, identities and social status.
        Instead of leaning on socially acceptable questions like, “What do you do?’ or “Where are
        you from?,” we focused on “Who are you?” and a myriad of subsequent questions like “What
        does happiness mean to you?”, “How do you want to grow old?” or “What was the last thing you
        cried about?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, countless people have found delight in using our carefully curated questions
        across the planet amongst a manifold of different contexts. From garden parties to strategic
        and innovation workshops, from orthodox jewish matchmaking dates to political negotiations;
        WhoCards have helped us to move beyond social anxiety, disconnection and loneliness.

      mission
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this age of disruption and complexity, when our differences are used to keep us separate,
      one of the most courageous things we can do is to show up for others with authenticity,
      vulnerability and openness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not we recognize it on a daily basis, we are all deeply interconnected. WhoCards’
      mission is to strengthen the authenticity of that interconnectedness, because we believe that
      a sense of honest homecoming to ourselves and each other has the power to spark a light strong
      enough to lead us out from anxiety and loneliness towards belonging and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that by speaking what's true for us and actively listening to others as they do the
      same, we can quiet the noise of the world and enter the warm hum of mutuality.

            We are humbled by the super organism we are inhabiting, planet Earth. We find our

            rooted its resiliency in its ability to respond to and adapt to anything that emerges.

            Our strong desire to learn and grow together creates an opportunity for us to humbly

            honestly. Why? Because we understand that even if our egos take a hit, there is only
            winning or learning to be gained in the process.
