      Our story
    </h3>
    <h2 class='text-3xl font-medium font-title leading-10'>The power of human connections</h2>
    <p class='text-sm leading-snug text-gray-dark pb-2'>
      In 2016, a dynamic, self-organized laboratory called Amanitas was born in order to explore
      radical collaboration and emergence for our future humanity. Amanitas was inspired by the
      superpowers and patterns of the natural world. Throughout a series of retreats, a community
      house and co-created events, we learnt, played and experimented around a core belief: That
      positive change does not originate from any single individual, rather it ebbs and flows as a
      force which guides a living system.
